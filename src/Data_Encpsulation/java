Main Method:
 base line program : jvm
Main method in java is the entry point/Starting point of execution
whenever we try to execute a java program, jvm looks for public static void main method and execute this
first main method execute and it call other methods for the execution

public Static void Main(String[] args):
 public has the scope every where in the project, easy for the JVM to find it out and execute.
 void: because the main method supposed to return no value.

 Static: when we make main method as Static then it is easy for the  JVM  to access the method directly with out creating object of the class.

 when ever we create a method/ variable as  static then no need of create an object of that class to access it.


NoSuchMethodError: when Jvm search for psvm when it doesn;t found the it with end up with this error.
