Main Method:
 base line program : jvm
Main method in java is the entry point/Starting point of execution
whenever we try to execute a java program, jvm looks for public static void main method and execute this
first main method execute and it call other methods for the execution

public Static void Main(String[] args):
 public has the scope every where in the project, easy for the JVM to find it out and execute.
 void: because the main method supposed to return no value.

 Static: when we make main method as Static then it is easy for the  JVM  to access the method directly with out creating object of the class.

 when ever we create a method/ variable as  static then no need of create an object of that class to access it.


NoSuchMethodError: when Jvm search for psvm when it doesn;t found the it with end up with this error.
===================================================

StringBuilder: StringBuilder is used to create the mutable strings(modified STRINGS)
In java string object is immutable ,cannot modified once it is created.

Scanner class is used to accept the user input during the course of execution of the java program.

inheritance: in java we can inherit the futures of one class to the another
reusability  the code is created in some other class
IS-A relationship from the child to the Parent
=====================================
Method Overriding:

when a super class and sub class has the same name and same arguments then the method from the child class overrides the  method from the parent class.
Exact same name and same no of arguments shared b/w the super and sub class (parent and child class) then when you create a object of child class and called that methods then the child or sub class implementation of that class over rides the parent


Method Overloading: This happen with same name of same class and they would differ in terms of Arguments.

Polymorphism : ability of an object to get many forms

Abstraction:
Interface is the collection of abstract methods
we need to specify abstract keyword in order to specify it as abstract method.( in abstract class it can have abstract methods and non abstract methods)
but over in interface all the methods are abstract can't have implementation
in interface all the methods are consider as abstract methods except static methods and default methods.

A class can implement an interface

to inherit class to class
 class extends another class

interface  very similar to abstract class, contains the collection of abstract methods which provide only the functionality details and actual implementation can be in the sub classes.

How can interface another interface
with the help of extends keyword
A class cannot have multiple inheritance, extends from multiple classes
Interface doesn't has the constructor
 class can't be the parent for interface.
 interface can be  parent for a class .

Final Keyword
It can be add to a method, filed, a class
when we add a final to a variable or a field it;s constant
in java all the constants are written in upper case
when we add final toa method it avoids the method over ridding
can inherit from the final class
==============================================
Array is the collection of similar data type.
